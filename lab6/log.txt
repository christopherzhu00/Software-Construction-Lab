Lab 6

First I make sure that I have the openssh-server and openssh-client installed by using the command: dpkg â€“get-selections | grep openssh. 
It only outputs: 
openssh-client install

instead of:
openssh-server install
openssh-client install

To fix this problem, I utilize the commands:
sudo apt-get install openssh-server 
sudo apt-get isntall openssh-client 

After a few moments of letting it finish, the correct output appears.

Server Side:
Next I work on the server side of the lab. I start off by using the command ssh-keygen and then pressing RETURN three times to not change the default location. The following output is shown below:
The key fingerprint is: 
75:0f:ac:c6:a3:73:44:29:e7:7d:63:e3:86:1e:28:d9 ubuntu@ubuntu 
The key's randomart image is: 
+--[ RSA 2048]----+

|           o     | 
|        . = +    | 
|         B + o   | 
|        S B . *  | 
|         * o = o | 
|        = E o o  | 
|         + . o   | 
|            .    | 
+-----------------+ 

Then I create an account for the client (Zach Bordofsky), by using the commands:  
sudo useradd -d /home/zachb -m zachb
sudo passwd zachb 
(I set his password to nicole for personal reasons) 

Next I create a .ssh directory for Zach by using the commands: 
cd /home/zachb
sudo mkdir .ssh

Then I change the ownership and permission on the .ssh directory with the folowing commands: 
sudo chown -R zachb .ssh :128.97.84.58 
sudo chmod 700 .ssh 

I then have my partner follow the instructions and he was correctly as able to run a command on the remote host. Hooray!


Client Side:
After my partner has finished his commands for setting up the servers, I now perform the commands for the client. 

I first make sure I cd back to the home directory by using the command: 
cd

Next, I use the command ssh-keygen again and overwrite the old keygen to generate the public and private keys. I obtain the following output: 
The key fingerprint is: 
16:50:3c:83:0a:b2:4b:1c:f4:de:97:0b:3d:da:53:45 ubuntu@ubuntu 
The key's randomart image is: 
+--[ RSA 2048]----+

|.o.o .  .o .     | 
|.o. o . ...      | 
|.. . o =S.       | 
|.     =.+        | 
|     . +         | 
|        .        | 
|                 | 
+-----------------+ 
Next I copy the public key to the server for keybased authentication with the command: 
ssh-copy-id -i chris@128.97.84.57

Afterwards, I add the private key to authentication agent by using the command: 
ssh-add 
Next I actually SSH to the server by using the command: 
ssh chris@128.97.84.57

After it works, I use the command 'exit' and then check with the command: 
ssh -X chris@128.97.84.57

to use X11 session forwarding. 
After I confirm that both work, I want to run a command on the remote host by using the commands: 
xterm
gedit 
firefox 
And all of these work so hooray!~
