Homework Questions

1. If the other team had been observing all the bytes which go across the 
network, the network should still be secure since the message is 
encrypted. Thus, the bytes that they look at should just be a mess which 
doesn't resemble anything since the bytes themselves are encrypted. My 
answer would change if (1) the other teams had tapped our keyboards and 
observed all the keystrokes because then they are able to see the messages 
before they are encrypted and thus the encryption doesn't matter. After the 
data has been encrypted do the perpetrators not know what the message is, 
but if they already know before the encryption begins, the resulting network 
will not be secure. If they had physical control of my USB, it would also 
be insecure because they would have access to all the files since the data 
when booting off of the USB would be stored within the USB itself which 
includes the public and private keys which can be used to decrypt. They 
also have the actual files themselves which would make the network not 
secure. 

2. The grp --verify command in the following instructions doesn't 
actually verify that I personally made the tar file since it only checks 
to see whether the file has been modified since it has last been signed. 
This can be abused by other people because they can just change it and then 
sign it which would not cause any problem with the grp --verify command 
since it would say the file has not been modified since the last time it was 
signed. In order to fix this problem, I would have to use a third party 
verification method such as the certificate based authentication which 
keeps track of the actual owner's signature so basically acts as a middle 
man to check the authenticity of a file. This method is prevalent in 
today's society and is used by almost all companies to make sure data 
isn't tampered.
