I first make a really large file so that I can get a more accurate gauge on 
the time difference between sfrob and sfrobu by using the command: 
head --bytes=10000000 /dev/urandom > reallyreallybigfile.txt

The results are shown below:
sfrob
real    0m11.627s
user    0m0.440s
sys     0m0.120s



sfrobu
Comparisons: 551490

real    0m12.789s
user    0m0.375s
sys     0m2.908s

As the results shows, it becomes apparent that actually using system calls 
with sfrobu takes longer for the system than using the library with sfrob 
which does it for us. 

I then test this on various input line files by creating a random text file 
with 10 words in notepad++ to create a file representing 10 words. To get a 
file with 100 words, I then copy paste it by 10 times. I keep doing this 
until I get all powers of 10 for input words until 100000.

# of words		# of Comparisons

10				23
100				485
1000			7660
10000			104583
100000			1329329


My show a big-O value of a little less than nlogn base 2 is valid since 
qsort has a big-o value of nlogn base 2.
